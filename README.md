# Game Description
You are a knight that is searching for gold. You have to avoid the slimey monsters in your path
to collect all the coins!

## Game Mechanic
The main game mechanics are the character movement (left, right, jump) and interactions with coins and monsters (picking up coins and dying when contacting with monsters)

## Coding Challenge
Hardest part of the game to code was probably the sound, I had problems with the background music restarting when the character died and also not looping, as well as overlap problems with the coin pickup sound effects.

## Interesting feature
I think the most interesting feature in the game is the map and its moving parts (platforms, enemies etc.)

# Reflection

Reflecting on my work and learning during this assignment I think that I have achieved a pretty good understanding of Godot and the way it works. I originally tried using Unreal and then tried Godot, and I turned out to really love Godot. I made some errors along the way, running out of time and not implementing a menu screen from the start (and win screen) but I know how I would do them
